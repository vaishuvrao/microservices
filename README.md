# Deploy Microservices using Spring Cloud Framework
This work is on Java Spring Cloud Deploy Microservices. Which can be accomplished by completing each task in the project:

:one: Create a Java microservice client application from an existing Spring Boot Rest application.\
:two: Create a Git configuration Repository to manage Spring Cloud configuration properties.\
:three: Create a Spring Cloud Configuration Server to manage configurations for the Microservices Application.\
:four: Create a Eureka Registry Server to manage Microservice instances and view the Spring Cloud System Status.\
:five: Use server port 8080 to locate both Spring Microservices on the same Server port using Zuul.

By end of this project you will use the spring cloud to deploy a pair of microservices that will be used to inject the pair of random numbers into the math quiz

Microservices are simply a set of small applications that can communicate with one another to create an application. The advantages of using micro services is they are quick to develop and test. In addition, they scale well when demand increases for one part of the application, and they are easier to maintain since each microservice is not strongly coupled to the other. The goal of the application within an application group accessible using the same server and port number.

## Task1: 
:dart: Overview of the application\
:dart: Modify build.gradle to add spring cloud and registration dependencies\
:dart: Enable the RandApplication for Eureka Registration\
:dart: Add the application properties and bootstrap properties\
:dart: check the question application files.

=============check the file in RAND=============

Note: give the command ./gradlew to run the file
